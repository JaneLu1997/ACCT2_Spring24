                My idea for ideal dream place exists somehwere mountains and water meet, there's plenty of green. Yet it's not a strict nature only environment. It stores all your memory and lost objects from the past. Here, the physics and gravity work different than it is on the place. Everything you missed and lost will be forever stored here, and nothing will be lost or damaged again.
                First, we build the terrain, and changed the skybox:

                Then to add water, i realized I have to switch my file from Core to URP. Thus I redid that and added water. Along with other 3D objects, the space is pretty much done.

                After that, I start to think about the surroundings. As this head piece is for chosen new born SimChild, it should be in a hospital setting. Tablet displaying the baby's information should also be included.
